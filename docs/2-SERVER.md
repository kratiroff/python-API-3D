Server
======

HTML files need an address (url) so browsers can find them
There is a whole system on which the internet relies on... the DNS (domain name system)
    --> it maps a readable name www.google.com to a server address called IP (some number)

***
Massive confusion: physical server vs. the program called server
    * physical: a computer connected to the internet 24/7
    * program: a piece of code that runs on the physical server which dictates how data is handled
***

Flask: a python server framework ==> set of tools to builds web apps in python
    - template folder
    - static folder

$ pip install flask

1. create the simple server.py
2. place the html file in templates and render it
