HTML
====

Think of it as Word docs for the Internet
    * small size text files that can be sent over the IP network (yeah, that's just Internet)
    * maybe show dummy xml to explain markup languages

Browsers receive HTML and parses it into websites... but browsers do a lot more!

They run JS! <script></script>

Maybe cool to explain what CSS is: do zero CSS until the very end where a copy paste makes everything beautiful
