HTML
====

Think of it as Word docs for the Internet
    * small size text files that can be sent over the IP network (yeah, that's just Internet)
    * maybe show dummy xml to explain markup languages

Browsers receive HTML and parses it into websites... but browsers do a lot more!

1. open postman and fetch https://www.wikipedia.org/
2. create an index.html file with
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <head>
        <title>Python API D3</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <input type="text" />
        <select>
            <option>A</option>
            <option>B</option>
            <option>c</option>
        </select>
    </body>

</html>
```

Spoiler: They run JS! <script></script> (more later)

Maybe cool to explain what CSS is: do zero CSS until the very end where a copy paste makes everything beautiful
